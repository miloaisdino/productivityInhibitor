# About the project

Do you ever feel like you are being way too productive? 
Coding is simple, writing essays has never been a challenge and every homework is done weeks before its due.
There's just too much free time left for you! You are bored, unchallenged, unmotivated due to how trivial the world is and you yearn to be busy, to spend your time on something more meaningful than staring into blank space.
We believe this extension is exactly what you will need, a chrome extension we made specifically to decrease your productivity! This way, you can spend more time than needed staring at LED pixels and grinding your way to your next goal.
